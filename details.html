            <p class="details-p">How long have vampires been around? There are stories of vampire-like creatures from as early as ancient Greece! This centuries-old monster is said to be undead, meaning they are animated and act similar to a living human, but with no actual vitality. They survive by draining the living of their bodily fluid, primarily blood, by way of biting their victims with sharp, snake-like teeth. Sunlight will burn a vampire's skin, so they are active mostly at night. There are times that they can be active during the day, as long as the weather permits. This is why storms, mist and cloudy days contain a sense of foreboding. You never know what you could encounter when the sun isn't out!According to lore, their downfalls are crosses, silver and garlic, and can be extinguished by stabbing them in the heart with a wooden stake. To be safe though, it would work best to decapitate them.</p>
            <p class="details-p">A vampire is a mythical creature that subsists by feeding on the vital essence (generally in the form of blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires are undead creatures that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods which they inhabited while they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. Vampiric entities have been recorded in cultures around the world; the term vampire was popularized in Western Europe after reports of an 18th-century mass hysteria of a pre-existing folk belief in Southeastern and Eastern Europe that in some cases resulted in corpses being staked and people being accused of vampirism.</p>
            <p class="details-p">In modern times, the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures (such as the chupacabra) still persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalize this, creating the figure of the vampire to explain the mysteries of death. Porphyria was linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.[1]The charismatic and sophisticated vampire of modern fiction was born in 1819 with the publication of "The Vampyre" by the English writer John Polidori; the story was highly successful and arguably the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century. Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula is remembered as the quintessential vampire novel and provided the basis of the modern vampire legend, even though it was published after fellow Irish author Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu's 1872 novel Carmilla. The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire genre, still popular in the 21st century, with books, films, television shows, and video games. The vampire has since become a dominant figure in the horror genre. </p>
